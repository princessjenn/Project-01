## User Story
AS a user I WANT to click a button to translate Kanyes quotes SO THAT I can read them in Spanish as well as English
ALSO I WANT a feature where I can switch a toggle SO THAT I can decide if I want to view the page in dark or light mode

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN the webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN there are two working server-side apis
WHEN the local storage can store a light/dark theme toggle so THEN the user can store whether they want to view the page in light or dark mode
WHEN the UI is polished
WHEN the good coding quality standards are met (indentation,scoping,naming etc)
WHEN the user is able to use the click me button to translate the Kanye quote from english to spanish


We ran into a few problems while creating this webpage: 
- having the webpage centered. We fixed this by adding some margin and padding to the buttondiv in CSS
- getting the light/dark theme toggle to function correctly after refreshing the webpage
- getting the buttons to work without the english and spanish versions popping up at the same time. We fixed this by adding a class and id to the button in HTML for spanish, and creating an on click in java so that whenever the translate button is clicked then we will see the spanish translated text

Overall we had a lot of fun and enjoyed building this webpage as a group!
